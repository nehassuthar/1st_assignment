<h4 align="center">What is Lorem Ipsum?</h4>
<p align="center">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry<br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the an <br>unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type book.</p>

<h4 align="center">Where does it come from?</h4>

<p align="center">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has <br> roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 20 <br> old  Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College.</p>

<h4 align="center">Why do we use it?</h4>

<p align="center">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable a <br>content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem over <br>Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed. </p><br>
